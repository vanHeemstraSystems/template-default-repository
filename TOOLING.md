# Tooling

- [What's In My Toolkit - August 2025](https://hyperdev.matsuoka.com/p/whats-in-my-toolkit-august-2025)

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

### Claude Code & Claude MPM

Despite [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com/)'s recent hiccups with rate limiting and service stability, these remain the backbone of my development workflow. [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) handles the heavy lifting—complex refactoring, architectural discussions, multi-file changes that require deep context understanding.

[Claude MPM](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/claude-mpm) (Robert (Masa) Matsuoka - aka bobmatnyc - own orchestration framework) comes into play for larger projects where coordination between multiple agents provides better results than single-threaded development. Gives me both direct control and systematic automation.

Why I stick with them: When they work, they work better than anything else. Context window, reasoning quality, and code understanding remain unmatched. But I've learned to have backups ready.

### Augment Code

- [Augment (a better Cursor)](https://augmentcode.com): AI-enabled Integrated Development Environment

My $50/month insurance policy turned daily tool. Augment Code is fast, reliable, particularly effective for focused troubleshooting sessions where I need quick, targeted solutions rather than comprehensive analysis.

The remote agents feature has become unexpectedly useful — I can queue up documentation tasks or code cleanup while my laptop is closed or I'm in meetings. Not some massive productivity boost, but consistently useful.

When I reach for it: Quick debugging sessions, remote work when I can't keep the laptop running, sanity check when Claude Code responses feel off.

### Claude.AI (Web + Desktop)

My day starts and ends here. Morning routine involves research, planning, workflow integration with Linear. Evening winds down with notes consolidation, often pulling in recordings from Granola to create actionable summaries.

The Claude.AI desktop app stays available for those "quick question" moments that inevitably turn into deeper strategy discussions. I find myself using it for meta-thinking about projects—not just execution, but planning the execution.

Daily pattern: Research and planning in the morning, integration work throughout the day, synthesis and notes in the evening.

### Granola


### Fireflies

## Voice Prompting

## Email

### Spike

## Hardware

## MacBook Air M4 (32GB RAM)

## How This Fits Together

1) SuperWhisper dictates initial requirements into Claude.AI for planning. 
2) That planning flows to Claude Code for implementation.
3) Augment Code handles edge cases and quick fixes.
4) Meeting intelligence tools capture client feedback and discussions.
5) Everything runs smoothly on the M4 with enough RAM to avoid bottlenecks.

Not the most complex setup, but it handles the full development lifecycle from initial client conversations through production deployment.
