# Tooling

- [What's In My Toolkit - August 2025](https://hyperdev.matsuoka.com/p/whats-in-my-toolkit-august-2025)

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

### Claude Code & Claude MPM


### Augment Code

- [Augment (a better Cursor)](https://augmentcode.com): AI-enabled Integrated Development Environment

### Claude.AI (Web + Desktop)

### Warp Terminal


## Meetings

### Granola


### Fireflies

## Voice Prompting

### SuperWhisper

## Project Management

### Linear

## Email

### Spike

## Hardware

## MacBook Air M4 (32GB RAM)

## How This Fits Together

1) SuperWhisper dictates initial requirements into Claude.AI for planning. 
2) That planning flows to Claude Code for implementation.
3) Augment Code handles edge cases and quick fixes.
4) Meeting intelligence tools capture client feedback and discussions.
5) Everything runs smoothly on the M4 with enough RAM to avoid bottlenecks.

Not the most complex setup, but it handles the full development lifecycle from initial client conversations through production deployment.
