# Tooling

- [What's In My Toolkit - August 2025](https://hyperdev.matsuoka.com/p/whats-in-my-toolkit-august-2025)

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

### Claude Code & Claude MPM

Despite [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com/)'s recent hiccups with rate limiting and service stability, these remain the backbone of my development workflow. [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) handles the heavy liftingâ€”complex refactoring, architectural discussions, multi-file changes that require deep context understanding.

[Claude MPM](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/claude-mpm) (Robert (Masa) Matsuoka - aka bobmatnyc - own orchestration framework) comes into play for larger projects where coordination between multiple agents provides better results than single-threaded development. Gives me both direct control and systematic automation.

Why I stick with them: When they work, they work better than anything else. Context window, reasoning quality, and code understanding remain unmatched. But I've learned to have backups ready.

### Augment Code

- [Augment (a better Cursor)](https://augmentcode.com): AI-enabled Integrated Development Environment

### Claude.AI (Web + Desktop)

### Warp Terminal


## Meetings

### Granola


### Fireflies

## Voice Prompting

### SuperWhisper

## Project Management

### Linear

## Email

### Spike

## Hardware

## MacBook Air M4 (32GB RAM)

## How This Fits Together

1) SuperWhisper dictates initial requirements into Claude.AI for planning. 
2) That planning flows to Claude Code for implementation.
3) Augment Code handles edge cases and quick fixes.
4) Meeting intelligence tools capture client feedback and discussions.
5) Everything runs smoothly on the M4 with enough RAM to avoid bottlenecks.

Not the most complex setup, but it handles the full development lifecycle from initial client conversations through production deployment.
