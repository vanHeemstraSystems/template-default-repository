# Way of Working

## Goals:

- Feature branches tied to specific issues with clear naming conventions
- Commits that follow Conventional Commits format
- GitHub issues structured with proper taxonomies and clear acceptance criteria
- PRs that tell a coherent story of what changed and why
- Zero drift between code changes and their documentation
