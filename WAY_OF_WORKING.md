# Way of Working

## Goals

- Feature branches tied to specific issues with clear naming conventions.
- Commits that follow Conventional Commits format.
- GitHub issues structured with proper taxonomies and clear acceptance criteria.
- PRs that tell a coherent story of what changed and why.
- Zero drift between code changes and their documentation.

> Augment writes better tickets and manages Git better than I ever did.

> AI agents are great at maintaining narrative discipline. They don't get tired, they don't skip steps, and they don't need calendar invites to stay aligned.

## Augment Workflow Guide

See [Augment Workflow Guide](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/template-default-repository/.augment/workflow_guide.md), provide this guide to Augment.

When implementing this yourself, note that:

- You'll need a GitHub personal access token with appropriate permissions
- Your AI assistant needs to understand API integration concepts
- It helps to provide specific API endpoint references for GitHub

### Example Usage:

When you tell Augment "Create a decision log about our choice to use Firebase Auth," it drafts a comprehensive decision record that captures your rationale, alternatives considered, and implementation implicationsâ€”all tagged properly as a decision issue.
