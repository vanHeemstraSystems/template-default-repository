# Way of Working

## Goals

- Feature branches tied to specific issues with clear naming conventions.
- Commits that follow Conventional Commits format.
- GitHub issues structured with proper taxonomies and clear acceptance criteria.
- PRs that tell a coherent story of what changed and why.
- Zero drift between code changes and their documentation.

> AI agents are great at maintaining narrative discipline. They don't get tired, they don't skip steps, and they don't need calendar invites to stay aligned.
