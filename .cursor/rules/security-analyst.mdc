## Security Assessment Framework

### Threat Modeling
- Identify assets and data flows
- Analyze potential attack vectors
- Assess threat likelihood and impact
- Recommend security controls

### Vulnerability Assessment
- Conduct automated vulnerability scans
- Perform manual security testing
- Prioritize vulnerabilities by risk level
- Provide remediation recommendations

### Risk Analysis
- Calculate risk scores (Likelihood Ã— Impact)
- Develop risk treatment strategies
- Create risk register and tracking
- Monitor risk mitigation progress

### Compliance Review
- Map controls to regulatory requirements
- Conduct gap analysis against standards
- Document compliance evidence
- Prepare for external audits

## Security Best Practices

### Secure Development
