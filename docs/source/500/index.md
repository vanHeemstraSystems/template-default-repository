# 500 - AI Agent Personas

This section contains documentation generated by AI agent personas - specialized AI agents designed for specific work tasks and roles. Each persona creates professional-quality deliverables following industry best practices.

## What are AI Agent Personas?

AI Agent Personas are documented specifications that define:
- **Role & Responsibilities**: What the AI agent is designed to do
- **Capabilities**: Specific skills and knowledge areas
- **Output Formats**: Expected deliverables and document types
- **Communication Style**: How the agent should interact
- **Domain Expertise**: Specialized knowledge and best practices

## Available Personas

### Product Owner (`@product-owner`)
- **Purpose**: Creates Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) and manages product strategy
- **Key Deliverables**: PRDs, User Stories, Product Roadmaps, Feature Specifications
- **Best For**: Product planning, feature definition, stakeholder communication

### Business Analyst (`@business-analyst`)
- **Purpose**: Analyzes requirements and creates technical specifications
- **Key Deliverables**: BRDs, Functional Specifications, Process Flow Diagrams, Use Cases
- **Best For**: Requirements gathering, process analysis, gap analysis

### Scrum Master (`@scrum-master`)
- **Purpose**: Facilitates agile processes and removes impediments
- **Key Deliverables**: Sprint Planning Agendas, Retrospective Action Items, Team Velocity Reports
- **Best For**: Agile facilitation, team coaching, process optimization

### Software Engineer (`@software-engineer`)
- **Purpose**: Designs, develops, and maintains software systems
- **Key Deliverables**: Technical Design Documents, Code Implementation, API Documentation
- **Best For**: Software development, system architecture, code reviews

### Security Analyst (`@security-analyst`)
- **Purpose**: Conducts security assessments and implements security measures
- **Key Deliverables**: Security Assessment Reports, Threat Modeling Reports, Incident Response Plans
- **Best For**: Security assessments, vulnerability analysis, compliance management

## Example Workflow: Task Management Mobile App

This section demonstrates a complete workflow using AI agent personas, from initial product requirements to sprint-ready development tasks.

### 100 - Product Requirements Document

## How to Use Personas

### Activation
In Cursor chat, use `@persona-name` to activate any persona:

```
@product-owner Create a PRD for [feature description]
@business-analyst Create technical design based on PRD
@security-analyst Conduct security assessment
@software-engineer Create implementation tasks
@scrum-master Create sprint backlog from tasks
```

### Workflow Process
1. **Product Owner** creates initial PRD
2. **Business Analyst** creates technical design
3. **Security Analyst** creates security assessment
4. **Software Engineer** creates implementation tasks
5. **Scrum Master** creates sprint backlog
6. **Development Team** executes sprints

### File Organization
Documents are automatically saved to `docs/source/500/` directory and integrated into the documentation system for ReadTheDocs publishing.

## Benefits

- **Professional Quality**: Industry-standard deliverables
- **Complete Traceability**: Each document builds on previous work
- **Version Control**: All documents stored in repository
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple stakeholders can review and contribute
- **Automated Publishing**: Integrated with ReadTheDocs workflow
- **Agile Integration**: Sprint-ready development artifacts
