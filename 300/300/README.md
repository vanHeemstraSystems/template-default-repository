# 300 - Creating a New React Monorepo

**Warning**: Make sure you have installed and created the directory structure of ```hatch``` already. See [HATCH.md](../../HATCH.md)

Create a new React monorepo with the following command:

```
$ cd hatch-project/src # navigate to the 'hatch-project/src' sub-directory, previously created by hatch
$ mv hatch_project original_hatch_project # temporarily rename the hatch_project directory so nx will not complain
$ npx create-nx-workspace@latest hatch_project --preset=react-monorepo
```

When prompted, provide the following answers:

```
Need to install the following packages:
create-nx-workspace@20.4.0
Ok to proceed? (y)
```

Click y & ENTER.

NX Creating your v20.4.0 workspace.

Installing dependencies with npm
Successfully created the workspace: hatch_project

NX Directory is already under version control. Skipping initialization of git.

NX   Welcome to the Nx community! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒŸ Star Nx on GitHub: https://github.com/nrwl/nx
ðŸ“¢ Stay up to date on X: https://x.com/nxdevtools
ðŸ’¬ Discuss Nx on Discord: https://go.nx.dev/community
```

This will generate the following file and directory structure underneath the ```src``` directory (Note: ```hatch_project``` uses that same directory as previously created by Hatch. **This is intentional!**):

```
â””â”€ hatch_project
   â”œâ”€ ...
   â”œâ”€ apps
   â”‚  â”œâ”€ react-store
   â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ public
   â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€ ...
   â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ src
   â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ app
   â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ app.module.css
   â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ app.spec.tsx

   â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€ styles.css
   â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.html
   â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ project.json
   â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ tsconfig.app.json
   â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ tsconfig.json
   â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ tsconfig.spec.json
   â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€ vite.config.ts
   â”‚  â””â”€ react-store-e2e
   â”‚     â””â”€ ...
   â”œâ”€ nx.json
   â”œâ”€ tsconfig.base.json
   â””â”€ package.json
```

**Important**: Move all files previously in ```original_hatch_project``` to ```hatch_project``` and delete ```original_hatch_project```!

### Key Points:
- **`hatch_project/nx.json`**: Configuration for the Nx workspace.
- **`hatch_project/package.json`**: Dependencies and scripts specific to the project.
- **`hatch_project/tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration for the project.
- **`hatch_project/workspace.json` or `project.json`**: Defines the structure and projects within the workspace.

**IMPORTANT**: Modify **nx.json** so it can connect with Nx Cloud.

Hereâ€™s a sample `nx.json` configuration that supports Nx Cloud for your workspace:

```json
{
  "npmScope": "hatch_project",
  "affected": {
    "defaultBase": "main"
  },
  "tasksRunnerOptions": {
    "default": {
      "runner": "@nrwl/workspace/src/tasks-runner/default-task-runner",
      "options": {
        "cacheableOperations": ["build", "test", "lint"],
        "localCache": true
      }
    }
  },
  "projects": {
    "hatch_project": {
      "root": "src/hatch_project",
      "sourceRoot": "src/hatch_project/src",
      "projectType": "application",
      "targets": {
        "build": {
          "executor": "@nrwl/web:build",
          "options": {
            "outputPath": "dist/hatch_project",
            "index": "src/hatch_project/src/index.html",
            "main": "src/hatch_project/src/main.tsx",
            "polyfills": "src/hatch_project/src/polyfills.ts",
            "tsConfig": "src/hatch_project/tsconfig.app.json",
            "assets": ["src/hatch_project/src/favicon.ico", "src/hatch_project/src/assets"],
            "styles": ["src/hatch_project/src/styles.css"],
            "scripts": []
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notice that it prepends paths with ```src/``` (e.g., ```"root": "src/hatch_project",```) to allow for our **nested** directory structure.

### Key Sections:
- **`npmScope`**: Defines the scope for your packages.
- **`affected.defaultBase`**: Specifies the default branch for determining affected projects.
- **`tasksRunnerOptions`**: Configures caching and task running options.
- **`projects`**: Contains the project configuration, specifying the root and source root paths, project type, and build targets.

Adjust paths and options as necessary to fit your specific project structure. This configuration will help Nx Cloud identify and manage your workspace correctly.

Make sure to run the **build** command from the `/hatch-project/src` directory to ensure it recognizes the workspace correctly:
```
$ nx build hatch_project
```

This structure should allow Nx Cloud to detect the workspace properly.

Run the command to **connect** your workspace to Nx Cloud from the root directory of the `hatch-project`, specifically:

```
$ cd /hatch-project/
```

The command to connect to Nx Cloud is:

```
$ nx connect-to-nx-cloud
```

This will initiate the configuration process for Nx Cloud within your workspace.
