# 300 - Creating a New React Monorepo

**Warning**: Make sure you have installed and created the directory structure of ```hatch``` already. See [HATCH.md](../../HATCH.md)

Create a new React monorepo with the following command:

```
$ cd hatch-project/src # navigate to the 'hatch-project/src' sub-directory, previously created by hatch
$ mv hatch_project original_hatch_project # temporarily rename the hatch_project directory so nx will not complain
$ npx create-nx-workspace@latest hatch_project --preset=react-monorepo
```

When prompted, provide the following answers:

```
Need to install the following packages:

NX   Welcome to the Nx community! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒŸ Star Nx on GitHub: https://github.com/nrwl/nx
ðŸ“¢ Stay up to date on X: https://x.com/nxdevtools
ðŸ’¬ Discuss Nx on Discord: https://go.nx.dev/community
```

This will generate the following file and directory structure underneath the ```src``` directory (Note: ```hatch_project``` uses that same directory as previously created by Hatch. **This is intentional!**):

```
â””â”€ hatch_project
   â”œâ”€ ...
   â”œâ”€ apps
   â”‚  â”œâ”€ react-store
   â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ public
   â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€ ...
   â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ src
   â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ app

   â”‚     â””â”€ ...
   â”œâ”€ nx.json
   â”œâ”€ tsconfig.base.json
   â””â”€ package.json
```

**Important**: Move all files previously in ```original_hatch_project``` to ```hatch_project``` and delete ```original_hatch_project```!
